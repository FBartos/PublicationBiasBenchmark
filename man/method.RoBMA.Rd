\usage{
\method{method}{RoBMA}(method_name, data, settings)
}
\arguments{
\item{method_name}{Method name (automatically passed)}

\item{data}{Data frame with yi (effect sizes), sei (standard errors), es_type
(either \code{"SMD"} for Cohen's d / Hedge's g, \code{"logOR"} for log odds
ratio, \code{"z"} for Fisher's z, or \code{"r"} for correlations. Defaults to
\code{"none"} which re-scales the default priors to unit-information width based
on total sample size supplied \code{"ni"}.)}

\item{settings}{List of method settings (see Details.)}
}
\value{
Data frame with RoBMA results
}
\description{
Implements the robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) method that uses
Bayesian model-averaging to combine results across several complementary
publication bias adjustment methods. See
\insertCite{maier2023robust;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} and
\insertCite{bartos2023robust;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for
details.

Note that the prior settings is dispatched based on \code{"es_type"} column attached
to the dataset. The resulting estimates are then summarized on the same scale
as was the dataset input (for \code{"r"}, heterogeneity is summarized on Fisher's z).

\details{
The following settings are implemented \describe{
\item{\code{"default"}}{RoBMA-PSMA with publication bias adjustment as described in
\insertCite{bartos2023robust;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark}.
(the MCMC settings was reduced to speed-up the simulations) with the
three-level specification whenever \code{"study_ids"} are supplied with the data}
