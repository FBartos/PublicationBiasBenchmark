\description{
Implements the endogenous kink (EK) method proposed by Bom and Rachinger for
publication bias correction in meta-analysis. This method modifies the PET-PEESE
approach by incorporating a non-linear relationship between publication bias and
standard errors through a kinked regression specification. The method recognizes
that when the true effect is non-zero, there is minimal publication selection
when standard errors are very small (since most estimates are significant), but
selection increases as standard errors grow. The kink point is endogenously
determined using a two-step procedure based on the confidence interval of the
initial effect estimate. See
\insertCite{bom2019kinked;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for details.

# Generate some example data
data <- data.frame(
  yi = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.25),
  sei = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.08, 0.12, 0.09)

# Apply EK method
result <- run_method("EK", data)
