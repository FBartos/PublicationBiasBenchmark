\usage{
\method{method}{WILS}(method_name, data, settings = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{method_name}{Method name (automatically passed)}

\item{data}{Data frame with yi (effect sizes) and sei (standard errors)}

\item{settings}{List of method settings (no settings version are implemented)}
}
\value{
Data frame with WILS results
}
\description{
Implements the weighted and iterated least squares (WILS) method for publication
bias correction in meta-analysis. The method is based on the idea of using excess statistical
significance (ESS) to identify how many underpowered studies should be removed to
reduce publication selection bias. See
\insertCite{stanley2024harnessing;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for details.

# Generate some example data
data <- data.frame(
  yi = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.25),
  sei = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.08, 0.12, 0.09)
)

# Apply WILS method
result <- run_method("WILS", data)
print(result)
